# Challenge #18: ðŸ“‡ Santa's Magic Agenda

#### Level: `ðŸ”´ HARD`

## Instructions

Santa Claus has a magic diary ðŸ“‡ where he keeps the addresses of the children to deliver the presents. The problem: `the diary's information is mixed and misformatted`. The lines contain a magic phone number, a child's name, and their address, but everything is surrounded by strange characters.

Santa needs your help to find specific information from the diary. Write a function that, `given the diary's content and a phone number, returns the child's name and address`.

Keep in mind that in the diary:

- Phone numbers are formatted as +X-YYY-YYY-YYY (where X is one or two digits, and Y is a digit).
- Each child's name is always between < and >

The idea is for you to write a function that, given the full phone number or part of it, returns the child's name and address. `If it doesn't find anything or there is more than one result`, you must return null.

**Examples:**

```js
const agenda = `+34-600-123-456 Calle Gran Via 12 <Juan Perez>
Plaza Mayor 45 Madrid 28013 <Maria Gomez> +34-600-987-654
<Carlos Ruiz> +1-800-555-0199 Fifth Ave New York`

findInAgenda(agenda, '34-600-123-456')
// { name: "Juan Perez", address: "Calle Gran Via 12" }

findInAgenda(agenda, '600-987')
// { name: "Maria Gomez", address: "Plaza Mayor 45 Madrid 28013" }

findInAgenda(agenda, '111')
// null
// Explanation: No results

findInAgenda(agenda, '1')
// null
// Explanation: Too many results
```

## Solutions

- **JavaScript**

  ```js
  /**
  * @param {string} agenda
  * @param {string} phone
  * @returns {{ name: string, address: string } | null}
  */
  function findInAgenda(agenda, phone) {
    function findInAgenda(agenda, phone) {
    const kids = agenda.split('\n').filter(kid => kid.includes(phone))
    const kidInfo = {
      name: kids[0]?.match(/<(.*)>/)[1],
      address: kids[0]?.replaceAll(/<.*>|\+[\d-]+/g, '').trim()
    }
    return [kidInfo, null][+(kids.length != 1)]
  }
  ```

- **TypeScript**

  ```ts
  function findInAgenda(agenda: string, phone: string): { name: string; address: string } | null {
    const kids = agenda.split('\n').filter(item => item.includes(phone))
    if (kids.length != 1) return null
    return {
      name: kids[0].match(/<(.*)>/)[1],
      address: kids[0].replaceAll(/<.*>|\+[\d-]+/g, '').trim()
    }
  }
  ```

- **Python**

  ```py
